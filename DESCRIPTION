Description: Zip2dma was created to allow for quicker segmentation when working with 
    marketing data that includes zipcode, but no DMA information. Oftentimes, 
    marketing impressions are bought against Designated Market Areas (DMAs), which
    is a specific grouping of areas defined by Nielsen(R). 
    This package loads a translation table from the Harvard Dataverse 
    and then allows users to join DMA information to their dataset with ease.
